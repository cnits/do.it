I encountered some of problems:

1. How to prevent changing a invalid value for a specific data type?
    > let i = 0;
    > i = 'String'; // Must throw an error at here

2. Loading a large js file vs each of js files with same size? And why?

3. What happens when opening the same file at the same time in Nodejs?

4. What will we must do when setting up a Nodejs app?

5. Typescript vs ES6?

6. How to trigger *render* funcion in Reactjs?
